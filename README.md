# WOPR
The NORAD operating systme for WOPR, used during the 1980s for war simulations. 

One notable event, was when WOPR staged a massive Soviet first strike with hundreds of missiles, submarines, and bombers. Believing the attack to be genuine, NORAD prepared to retaliate, and only narrowly avoided a nuclear apocalypse.

The full WOPR OS is included here, for educational purposes only.
